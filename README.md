# STM32F769 Discovery Board - Button Indicator with FreeRTOS & Qt for MCUs

This repository contains the firmware and application code for a project demonstrating an indicator icon with color change on the STM32F769 Discovery board, triggered by a user button press. The project utilizes FreeRTOS for real-time task management on the embedded side and Qt for MCUs for the graphical user interface.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to showcase a basic interaction between embedded hardware and a graphical user interface:

* **Embedded Firmware (STM32F769):** Detects a user button press using an external interrupt and manages the button state using FreeRTOS.

* **Qt for MCUs Application:** Displays a visual indicator (a circle) on the board's LCD screen. The color of this indicator changes based on the button's state received from the embedded firmware.

## Folder Structure

The project is organized into the following main directories:

* `.git/`: Git repository metadata.

* `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git (e.g., build artifacts, temporary files).

* `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

* `Docs/`: Contains project-specific documentation, notes, datasheets, or any relevant diagrams.

* `Embedded/`: Houses all the source code and project files for the STM32F769 firmware.

    * `Core/`: STM32CubeIDE generated core files (startup, system configuration).

    * `Drivers/`: HAL/LL drivers for STM32 peripherals and CMSIS.

    * `FreeRTOS/`: The FreeRTOS kernel source files.

    * `Inc/`: Custom header files for the embedded application (e.g., `button_task.h`).

    * `Src/`: Custom source files for the embedded application (e.g., `button_task.c`, `main.c`).

    * `Middlewares/`: Any additional middleware components used (e.g., USB, FatFs).

    * `STM32CubeIDE/`: Project files specific to STM32CubeIDE (the recommended IDE). This directory will also contain the `Debug/` folder with build outputs.

* `Frontend/`: Contains all the source code and project files for the Qt for MCUs application.

    * `src/`: C++ source files (e.g., `buttoncontroller.h`, `buttoncontroller.cpp`, `main.cpp`).

    * `qml/`: QML source files for the user interface (e.g., `main.qml`).

    * `resources/`: Any assets like images or fonts used by the Qt application.

    * `CMakeLists.txt` (or `.pro` for qmake): Build configuration for the Qt application.

    * `build/`: Build output for the Qt application.

* `Tools/`: Any custom scripts or utilities related to the project (e.g., flashing scripts, data parsing tools).

## Getting Started

To set up and run this project, you will need:

1.  **Hardware:**

    * STM32F769 Discovery Kit (STM32F769I-DISCO)

    * USB Micro-B cable (for power, debugging, and programming)

2.  **Software:**

    * **STM32CubeIDE:** Download and install the latest version from the STMicroelectronics website. This IDE will be used to compile and flash the embedded firmware.

    * **Qt for MCUs SDK:** Obtain and install the Qt for MCUs SDK. Note that this is a commercial product, and you may need an evaluation license. This SDK includes Qt Creator for developing the GUI.

### Building and Flashing the Embedded Firmware

1.  **Import Project:** Open STM32CubeIDE and import the project located in `Embedded/STM32CubeIDE/`.

2.  **Configure GPIO:** Ensure that PA0 is configured as an external interrupt with a pull-up resistor in STM32CubeMX (integrated within STM32CubeIDE).

3.  **Build:** Build the project. This will generate the `.elf` and `.hex` files in the `Embedded/STM32CubeIDE/Debug/` directory.

4.  **Flash:** Connect your STM32F769 Discovery board to your PC via USB. Use the built-in ST-LINK debugger within STM32CubeIDE to flash the compiled firmware to the board.

### Building and Deploying the Qt for MCUs Application

1.  **Open Project:** Open Qt Creator (part of the Qt for MCUs SDK) and open the project located in `Frontend/CMakeLists.txt` (or the `.pro` file if using qmake).

2.  **Configure Kit:** Ensure you have a Qt for MCUs kit configured in Qt Creator that targets your STM32F769 board.

3.  **Build:** Build the Qt application.

4.  **Deploy:** Deploy the Qt application to your STM32F769 Discovery board. The method for deployment will depend on your Qt for MCUs setup (e.g., via ST-LINK, SD card, or network).

### Interfacing between Embedded and Qt

The current conceptual code uses a `volatile uint8_t buttonPressedFlag` as a shared variable. In a real-world Qt for MCUs project on an STM32, the communication mechanism would be more robust, potentially involving:

* **Shared Memory:** If the Qt application and FreeRTOS run on the same MCU, a dedicated shared memory region can be used.

* **Inter-Process Communication (IPC):** If Qt for MCUs runs on a separate core or processor, a communication protocol (e.g., UART, SPI, or a custom IPC layer) would be necessary.

* **Custom Event Mechanism:** Qt for MCUs might provide specific mechanisms for event-driven communication from the embedded layer.

Refer to the comments in the C and C++ code for conceptual details on this interface.
